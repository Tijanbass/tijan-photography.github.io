					<h4>MY FIRST WEEK LEARNING ADOBE PHOTOSHOP EXPERIENCE.</h4>
					<p>
						<strong>First Day Experience Using Adobe Photoshop</strong> </a>.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						When I was in middle school, I always wondered how some of the context-based animated and graphic images and photos were.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Until I saw my friend Muhammed display an interface of different designing software (Photoshop, Illustrator, and CorelDRAW), amazing but confusing . Since then, I have had the spirit of starting to learn how to use one of those designing software, but I was not sure about which one to start with. Another thing that delayed me from starting is that I kept procrastinating. I wish I had started way earlier. Before my departure to Japan, I decided to install one of the design software packages, “Photoshop,” based on the video recommendation from YouTube and started practising in the first week of April upon my arrival.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						<strong>What Were Your First Impressions?</strong>
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						In the past, I had used Paint for designing, and I thought the interface would be similar, but I was disappointed—not really disappointed, but surprisingly amazed with the software. Everything seemed complicated before I realized it was just a combination of different basic designing tools.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						<strong>How Do You Begin to Learn?</strong>
						<br>
					<p>
						As the saying goes, practice makes perfect, and I felt compelled to take the same approach to the learning process by practising. I decided to open YouTube and follow a beginner’s guide step by step. Initially, it was difficult because I had to spend a long time trying to locate certain tools. Now, I am starting to understand how to use some of the basic tools.
